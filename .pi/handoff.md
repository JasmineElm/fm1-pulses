# FM-1 Pulses — handoff

## Mission

A **browser sequence generator for the M-VAVE FM-1** (vanilla JS, no build step,
no deps). Shape randomness with sliders → generate a **bank of 16 phrases** →
hear them in the browser → **freeze** them into the FM-1's own sequencer patterns
over Web MIDI (SysEx `0x20`). Also works as a **live MIDI broadcaster** (loop the
selected slot and morph it in real time).

- **Live:** https://mene311.github.io/fm1-pulses/
- **Repo:** `github.com/mene311/fm1-pulses` (public) — Pages deploys from `main` / root
- **Local:** `~/fm1-pulses/` (phone — it is phone-local, no SSH needed)
- **Device notes / tools:** `~/Projects/mvave-fm1/` (see its README)
- **Bluetooth:** the FM-1 has native **BLE MIDI** (documented + the standard BLE-MIDI
  GATT UUIDs are in its firmware). Plan, evidence, risks and the verification ladder live
  in **`notes/BLUETOOTH-PLAN.md`** — planned, not implemented.

## Progress

**Toolchain**
- [x] `js/pattern.js` — SysEx `0x20` encoder, byte-verified against Virtual-FM-1's
      `sync/Fm1Seq.cpp` (8 msgs × 177 bytes, checksum included)
- [x] `js/generator.js` — LFO → distribution → quantizer → gate → Deja Vu;
      `generateBank()` = **16 distinct slots from one seed**, `Drift` evolves the
      parameters slot 1 → 16
- [x] `js/midi.js` — finds the FM-1, sends patterns and **reads the reply**
      (surfaces `status 3 = sequencer playing` instead of failing silently)
- [x] `js/audio.js` — small 2-op FM Web Audio preview (hear it with no device)
- [x] `js/app.js` — all UI wiring

**Features**
- [x] Bank strip (16 mini step-maps), tap to select, `←`/`→`
- [x] 64-step grid, one **circle** per step (white = rest, accent = note)
- [x] **Step editing + locks** — click a step, `±` semitone, `✕` empty; edits
      **lock** the step so it survives regeneration; "clear all locks" releases
- [x] **Live loop** — ▶ Play loops the selected slot; any slider re-derives the
      bank in real time (debounced 40 ms) and the loop follows within a step;
      playhead shows the current step
- [x] **Freeze → FM-1** (selected) / **Send all 16**
- [x] **7 themes** = the FM-1's own (decoded from its firmware)
- [x] Tooltips on every control + typeable number boxes
- [x] **LFO rate is "LFO cycles": cycles across the pattern** (1–16, 0.5 step,
      continuous, no snapping — capped at 16 after listening tests; at 1/32 the high
      rates just read as jitter). `div = len / cycles`; periodic waves are floored at
      div 2.5 so a sine cannot collapse (it degenerates at div 1 and 2 — phase 0 and ½
      both read 0). Multiples of the bar count repeat, fractional ones drift. Default 4.
- [x] **`random` wave** — a Marbles-style stochastic source. It draws a fresh value
      every LFO-rate steps and holds it; `spread` picks the distribution
      (uniform / bell / extremes / constant) and `bias` is a real monotonic skew.
      The deterministic waves are unchanged as contours. Verified: `random` gives
      30 pitches at /1 and 4 at /16 (a sine at /4 is stuck at 3); 16/16 distinct
      slots even at Gate 100%.
- [x] **Bias fixed** — it was a second amplitude (positive values were clamped to a
      no-op). Now `skew(v,bias) = v^(3^-bias)`: measured mean note 53→69 as bias
      goes −100→+100, range unchanged.
- [x] Amplitude/offset show the **notes** they produce; magnet snaps at
      root/3rd/5th/octave
- [x] **Offset is the centre (median) of the pitch range; Amplitude is its
      half-width** — notes span `centre ± 18·amp` semitones, so Amplitude 0 sits
      exactly on the Offset note. The Amplitude readout shows that offset-centred
      range, and `generator.js` no longer has the old "Amplitude 0 = scale root"
      special case (it made 0% ignore Offset).
- [x] **Swing is audible in the browser** — `swingFrac()` delays every offbeat,
      50% straight → 75% triplet (2:1). Before this the slider only wrote the
      header byte for the FM-1 and the browser audition ignored it.
- [x] **Clear all 16** button — writes a full 64-step empty pattern over every slot.
      ⚠ Unresolved on hardware: a single **Freeze** works (Android Chrome) but
      Clear fails with SysEx status 3 even with the FM-1's sequencer stopped, so
      the FM-1 may refuse an all-empty pattern. Probe files made for the verified
      path: `~/probe-empty64.syx`, `~/probe-empty1.syx`; test with
      `~/fm1tool.sh write ~/probe-empty64.syx` (a non-empty `~/fm1-mvp/*.syx` is
      the control). If empty patterns are refused, either find the real erase or
      drop the button.
- [x] **Unipolar** checkbox — Off: notes spread both ways around the Offset note.
      On: the Offset note is the floor and notes only rise from it.
- [x] **Octave up** (0–100%) — chance a note jumps +12. Same scale degree, so it
      stays in key. Own RNG stream, so moving it never reshuffles the melody.
- [x] **Root gravity** (0–100%) — chance a note is pulled to the nearest root note,
      keeping its register. Own RNG stream.
- [x] **Humanize** (0–100%) — per-note velocity jitter, ±40. Own RNG stream. Velocity
      and Humanize only affect the browser / live MIDI; the FM-1 plays its own
      velocity on pattern playback.
- [x] **Grid snap** (0–100%) + **Snap grid** (slider 2–8 steps, odd values allowed).
      Snap keeps only notes that already sit on a grid line, so Gate still decides how
      many lines fire — density and grid no longer fight. Off-grid notes become rests.
- [x] **Loop** (2 → Length÷2 steps, odd allowed) + **Deja Vu** (0–100%). Deja Vu's old
      cross-slot memory is gone: it now repeats the first N steps of the pattern
      itself, filling up to Length, with Deja Vu as the chance each later step loops
      back. This also un-broke Drift (cross-slot reuse used to make all 16 slots
      identical at Deja Vu 100%).
- [x] **`bell` fixed** — it used to push values *away* from the centre; now
      centre-weighted in both the periodic and random paths.
- [x] Defaults: note value 1/16, LFO cycles 4, Loop 8, Deja Vu 0 (so the loop is off on load)

**BLE probe (2026-10-03) — `probe/`**
- [x] `probe/encode.js` — DOM/Bluetooth-free byte layer: BLE-MIDI `packetize`,
      `0x11` read, `0x20` write, `createSysexReassembler`, `decodeReply`.
      This is the byte half of the future `BleTransport`.
- [x] `probe/ble.html` — throwaway Web Bluetooth page on Pages:
      connect → service/char dump → note on/off → `0x11` (R1) → `0x20` (R2).
      **https://mene311.github.io/fm1-pulses/probe/ble.html** (deployed, HTTP 200)
- [x] Byte-verified **before hardware**: `0x20` output is byte-identical to
      `fm1pat.py encode_write`; 177 B → 10 packets, all ≤ 20 B (MTU 23);
      reassembler round-trips byte-exact for reply lengths 0/20/127/128/179/180
      at **all 217** split points.
- [x] **Bug found:** the reply length field is 2× 7-bit groups ⇒ shift is **7**,
      not 8. `js/midi.js` and `fm1tool.c` both use `<< 8`, which cannot represent
      a length ≥ 128. Unused in both, so harmless — but wrong.
- [ ] **Run the ladder on the phone (Chrome, FM-1 paired to the phone).**
      Hardware is the last gate; nothing else stays blocked on it.

## Rack UI (the app now) — session 2026-10-04

**`index.html` IS the rack UI.** The slider version is archived as
**`sliders.html`** (still live, built from `app.js` + `style.css`) and frozen at
tag **`mvp-1`**. `rack.html` no longer exists. Files: `index.html`, `js/rack.js`,
`js/knob.js`, `css/rack.css`, `css/fonts/*.woff2`.

**Layout: a 6-rail grid.** `.rack` is `grid-template-columns: repeat(6, 1fr)`;
sections span 2 rails (Rhythm / Global / Pitch, 3 rows each) or 6 (Shape,
Memory). Every control is exactly **one rail wide** so nothing drifts. Two traps
that broke alignment, both fixed:
- Section boxes must NOT use a border or horizontal padding — a 2-rail box and a
  6-rail box then resolve to different cell widths. Draw the box with
  `box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px` instead (costs no layout), and keep the internal
  grid gap equal to the panel gap.
- A short section must be centred on **whole columns** (`gridColumn = off + i`),
  never by width (`width: 50%; margin: auto`), which lands on half-rails.
  Verified: rail centres 152/238/324/410/496/582 at a constant 86px pitch.

**Control types: no text boxes on the panel at all.** `knob()` (tick ring, domed
cap, drag/wheel/keys, shift for fine, double-click resets) and `rotary()` (a knob
over an option list, `ticks = positions-1, majorEvery: 0` so there is one detent
per position). Wave/Scale/Note/Spread/Unipolar are rotaries; the seed is a knob
that rolls. Short panel legends for the waves (`randomWalk` → `walk`), full name
in the tooltip. `sw()` still exists in `knob.js` but is unused.

**THE PANEL IS THE CASE COLOUR.** Painting every surface near-black with a small
accent measured **79% near-black / 19% coloured** and read as dull. The FM-1 is a
*coloured case with dark knobs and a dark screen*, so `--panel` is the case
colour, the knobs are dark, and `.display` carries its **own local dark palette**
so steps stay a dark TFT. After: 32% near-black / 66% coloured.
**Ink is chosen per theme by comparing dark vs light**, never by a lightness
guess: orange needs dark ink (5.4:1) where light ink only managed 3.6:1.

**Themes are calibrated off real hardware.** Case/key pairs came from M-VAVE
product photos, then five were re-derived by **k-means clustering the user's own
close-up photos into 4 colours** and reading the two dominant non-shadow clusters
as case and keys — the shadow falls out as its own cluster, which is what fixed
purple's secondary. Tools: `~/fm1-colours.py` (k-means palettes) and
`~/fm1-calib.py` (one photo → proposed theme line + contrast checks).
Take the **75th percentile**, not the mean: the mean drags toward the shadowed
gaps between keys and read the brown unit too dark. **`black` and `grey` are
still product-shot estimates** — both are near-neutral, so a close-up gives two
greys clustering cannot separate from shadow.
Contrast is enforced numerically: legends 4.5:1 on the panel, dividers 3:1,
accent 4.5:1 on the dark screen.

**Typeface:** Barlow Semi Condensed, self-hosted (`css/fonts/`, 3 weights, 68KB,
SIL OFL) so the app still works offline. A condensed grotesk is what a panel
legend is printed in; the system sans read as a web dashboard.

**Audition timing had a real bug (but it was NOT the user's complaint).** The
gate floors (`max(12ms note, max 3ms release)`) ADDED to each step instead of
eating into it, because the loop slept relative durations: measured +5.4% at gate
5% on 1/16 and **+16.1% on 1/32**. Now the loop waits until an **absolute** target
time per step (measured +0.0%) and re-anchors if it falls >250 ms behind. Fixed in
both `rack.js` and `app.js`.
**Do not claim this explained the tempo mismatch.** The user's ear was about the
tempo, not the step length; this was a separate defect found while looking.

**The guide (`guide.html`) documents the rack**: Rhythm / Global / Pitch / Shape
/ Memory, each control tagged knob or switch.

### ⚠ Tempo does not reach the FM-1 (Baud Girl 093) — RESOLVED (2026-10-04): the firmware ignores the 0x20 tempo bytes

**The app sends it correctly.** Verified end to end: knob → `state.tempo` →
`syncHeader()` → `encodeWrite` → `tempoLo`/`tempoHi`; tempo 140 emits `0c 01`
which decodes back to 140, with `save` on the last of 8 parts. Layout matches the
reference codec exactly (`0x20, pat, part, save, len, rate, tempoLo, tempoHi,
gate, swing, voice`), and the reference's own test asserts `tempo = 97` survives.

**But the device never takes it. This is now deterministic, not intermittent.**
Full battery on the live unit (single USB session, every write acked `status 0`):

    freeze slot10 tempo=137  8/8 acked  → gset identical, tempo stays 200
    freeze slot10 tempo=137  8/8 acked  → gset identical
    freeze slot10 tempo=163  part-by-part, gset read after each part → never moves
    freeze slot 3 tempo=201  8/8 acked  → gset identical
    freeze slot10 tempo=45   8/8 acked  → gset identical (programmatic diff)
    freeze slot10 tempo=250  8/8 acked  → gset identical (programmatic diff)

while in the SAME messages, on the SAME device:

    swing gset[34+p] 75 → 50   ✓ landed (slots 3 and 10)
    rate  gset[50+p]  4 → 8    ✓ landed

So the 0x20 header fields work — except tempo. The firmware acks the write and
discards the tempo bytes. The unit's global tempo (currently 200, mirrored across
all 16 slots at `gset[66 + 2*p]`) is only changed by the unit's own controls so
far. The earlier "~99% worked" impression is superseded: with read-back
instrumentation, tempo never lands.

**Tooling built for the battery (phone-local, outside the repo):** `fm1batch`
(runs a whole test script in ONE USB session — repeated `termux-usb` claim/release
cycles make the FM-1 go deaf until replug, which cost an hour of false "device
dead" readings), `fm1-tempo-test.py` (patch .syx tempo/slot + checksum — checksum
is at byte 175, F7 at 176), `fm1param` (single-parameter write `F0 43 10 pp qq vv
F7`), `fm1clock` (F8 @ 24 PPQN stream).

**Quirk worth encoding in the app:** the FIRST `0x11` read of a USB session
returns 0 bytes; every later one works. Retry reads once before reporting failure.

**Remaining untested paths that COULD set the global BPM over MIDI:**
1. Single-param write `F0 43 10 pp qq vv F7` (params 0–155) — sweep them looking
   for the one that moves `gset[66]`. Not yet run (writes 156 unknown params).
2. `F8` MIDI Clock while the unit's sync mode is ON — streams tempo while the
   app is connected; the unit's stored BPM is untouched.

**Design consequence (what the app should do):**
- The device is the source of truth for BPM. Read `gset[66]` on connect and show
  "FM-1 holds N BPM"; sync the Tempo knob to it.
- The Tempo knob drives the browser player and is *attempted* at freeze, but the
  UI must say the device's own tempo governs standalone playback (caveat on the
  knob + in the freeze status line).
- Keep sending the tempo bytes in the header (acked, harmless) in case a firmware
  update honours them.

Facts that are solid:

- `gset[66 + 2*pattern]` holds the tempo, little-endian, plain BPM (the user set
  200 on the unit → `c8 00` at that offset, for **all 16 slots**). So the tempo
  behaves like a unit-global value mirrored per pattern.
- `GSET_ADDR = 0x01C0E840 + 5816`, `GSET_LEN = 137`; rate `gset[50+p]`, swing
  `gset[34+p]`, gate `gset[18+p]`, length `gset[98+p]` all confirmed live.
- The only memory opcodes: `0x04` write voice, `0x10` read sound, `0x11` read
  memory, `0x20` write pattern — plus the documented single-parameter write
  `F0 43 10 pp qq vv F7` (params 0–155), which is the one remaining candidate
  for a MIDI-side global-tempo write.
- The device's own tempo range goes to 300, so the hardware can hold it.

### Diagnostics kept in the app

- **`read device`** (status row) dumps the whole 137-byte settings block as hex,
  read-only. Change ONE thing on the FM-1, read again, and the bytes that move are
  that setting. This is how the tempo offset was pinned.
- **Freeze reports what the DEVICE holds**: `sent 140 bpm, device holds 140 bpm`,
  or on disagreement `sent 61 but the device holds 127 · gset[60..72] = …`.
  Implemented with `midi.readMemory(GSET_ADDR, 137)` (SysEx `0x11`), which needed
  `decodeReply` to return `len` + `data`.
- `GSET_ADDR = 0x01C0E840 + 5816`, `GSET_LEN = 137`.

### Verification habits (learned the hard way)

- `thum.io` never executes module JS. `microlink` races it, pin with
  `waitFor=#steps .cell` — and it has a **daily free-tier limit**; when exhausted,
  ask the user for a screenshot instead (analysis with PIL still works).
- The DeepSeek vision model **downscales the screenshot**, so it cannot see 1px
  grain, 4px screws or 2px shadows and will flatly say "no texture, no screws".
  It also misread a photo of the panel as "an aircraft cockpit". Trust PIL
  measurements against the pixels; use the model for prose, not geometry.
- **Run the edit, then commit, in SEPARATE tool calls.** Twice a file edit and the
  `git commit` ran in parallel and a CSS change silently never got committed,
  which then looked like "the fix did nothing".

## Key device facts (hard-won — do not re-learn)

- **Pattern write** (FM-1+VA / baud girl firmware only): SysEx `0x20`, 8 steps per
  message, 177 bytes:
  `F0 43 00 7D 20 <pat> <part> <save> <len> <rate> <tempoLo> <tempoHi> <gate> <swing> <voice> [8 × (rate, nNotes, notes[9], vels[9])] <sum> F7`,
  `sum = Σ(b ^ 0xFF) & 0x7F` over the body. `parts = max(2, ceil(len/8))`, last carries `save`.
- **Replies:** `F0 7D <7-bit LSB-first packed> F7` = `7D <kind> <status> <arg:4LE> <len:2LE> <data> <sum8>`.
  kind `0x50` sound, `0x51` mem, `0x52` pattern. status `0` done, `1` out of range,
  `2` damaged, **`3` the sequencer is playing**.
- **⚠ The FM-1's sequencer must be STOPPED** to accept a write (status 3 otherwise).
- **⚠ USB-MIDI SysEx framing trap:** CIN `0x04` for the start **and every
  continuation** packet; only the **last** packet uses `0x05/0x06/0x07`. Using
  `0x06` for continuations truncates every SysEx at its first continuation packet
  — the write silently does nothing. (Cost hours; Web MIDI does this for you.)
- **Themes:** `BGTHEME` table in `baudgirl_092_app.bin` @ `0x8ecbc` — 7 entries of
  12-byte name + 4 × RGB565 (accent, tint, dark bg, mid).

## Remaining

- [ ] **Bluetooth / wireless.** Probe built and byte-verified — see `probe/`.
  Remaining: run the hardware ladder, then implement `BleTransport` behind the
  transport seam. The FM-1 is a
  standard **BLE-MIDI peripheral** (`03B80E5A-…` service + `7772E5DB-…` data I/O
  characteristic, both found in `baudgirl_092_flash.bin`), so the browser can drive it via
  **Web Bluetooth** — no cable, no OS pairing, and unlike Web MIDI it also works on
  Android Chrome. Blocked on one binary unknown: **does the FM-1's BLE side accept the
  proprietary `0x20` pattern write, or only SysEx voice dumps?** Run the verification
  ladder (power on → BT scan → small SysEx → the 177-byte write) before writing any code.
- [ ] **Spread/Bias behave differently per wave, but neither is inert.** Both run on
      the periodic waves: Bias is a monotonic skew applied after the branch (sine mean
      note 53.3 → 67.5 across bias −100 → +100, range unchanged), and Spread reshapes
      the contour (sine: constant → 1 pitch, extremes → 2, bell/uniform → 9). The
      `random` wave is just where Spread's modes act as true probability
      distributions. Default wave is `sine`.
- [ ] **Verify a browser freeze against the real device.** The encoder and reply
  parsing are verified, but the Web MIDI freeze has not been confirmed on hardware
  (the phone path uses `mvave-fm1/mvp/fm1tool` over libusb, which IS verified).
  Note Android Chrome may not expose USB-OTG MIDI through Web MIDI — desktop works.
- [x] **Audition timing fixed in the rack** (`rack.js`): the loop now waits until an
      ABSOLUTE target time per step instead of accumulating relative sleeps. The gate
      floors (`max(12ms note, max 3ms release)`) used to ADD to each step instead of
      eating into it — measured **+5.4% slow at gate 5% on 1/16 and +16.1% on 1/32**,
      which is why the browser sounded slower than the FM-1. Now +0.0%. It also
      re-anchors if it falls >250ms behind (throttled tab) rather than bursting.
      `app.js` (the MVP) still has the old accumulating loop — not ported, MVP frozen.
- [ ] Still `setTimeout`, so there is residual jitter inside a step. A lookahead
      scheduler using `MIDIOutput.send(data, timestamp)` would remove that too.
- [ ] Magnet interval set (root/m3/4th/5th/octave) is a guess — tune to taste.
- [ ] No persistence yet (bank + locks are lost on reload) — localStorage.
- [ ] Out of scope of the app but open on the device side: per-step
  ratchet/chance/accent/tie & slide and per-pattern Chain are **not** carried by
  `0x20` (firmware layout unpublished); ties are reachable only via real-time
  recording. See `mvave-fm1/README.md`.

## How it's deployed

```bash
cd ~/Projects/fm1-pulses
git add -A && git commit -m "..." && git push    # Pages rebuilds in ~1 min
python3 -m http.server 8099                      # local (Web MIDI needs localhost/https)
```

GitHub Pages caches assets `max-age=600`. **Every asset is versioned through the
imports**: `index.html` loads `app.js?v=N`, and `app.js` imports
`generator.js?v=N`, `midi.js?v=N`, `pattern.js?v=N`, `audio.js?v=N`.
**When you change any JS, bump N in BOTH places** (`index.html` and the import
block at the top of `app.js`) or the browser will keep serving the stale module.
This bit once: the modules were unversioned, so `generator.js` changes never
reached the phone even though `app.js` did. `guide.html` carries its own `?v=N`
on `css/style.css`. To force a one-off refresh, open the page in Incognito or append
`?v=N` to the page URL.

## Session 2026-10-04 (evening) — euclid, perlin, Shape knob, tempo WYSIWYG

**The tempo verdict is now deterministic** (see the RESOLVED section above): the
firmware acks the 0x20 tempo bytes and discards them; 6 test tempos, zero gset
changes, while swing/rate/gate land. The single-param write (`F0 43 10 pp qq vv
F7`, params 0–155) is ALSO dead on this firmware — swept all 156, zero gset
moves, no replies. F8 clock streams cleanly but changes nothing stored. So the
device's own tempo is the only tempo.

**App changes for WYSIWYG tempo (rack only):**
- `syncDeviceTempo()` — reads the device's BPM (gset[66+2*slot]) and snaps the
  Tempo knob to it. Runs on connect, on "read device", and after every freeze
  (reusing the read-back data). The freeze status says plainly when the device
  ignored the sent tempo.
- Tempo knob tooltip + guide now state: BPM is device-global, freezing cannot
  change it, the app re-syncs to the device.

**New generator features (rack only; the slider app is frozen):**
- **Euclid gate mode** — Gate mode rotary `random`/`euclid`. In euclid mode the
  Gate % is the DENSITY: N = round(gate%×M) hits spread as evenly as possible
  (Bjorklund, rotated so rot 0 hits the downbeat) over M = Loop length (or 16 if
  the loop is off). Rotate knob (0–15, wraps) turns the mask. The loop info line
  shows `E(N,M) rot R`. Drift moves euclidRot ±6 across the bank.
- **Perlin wave** — 1D gradient noise contour (24 points per LFO cycle,
  smoothstep interpolation). Long evolving arcs; at 1 cycle it's one 64-step
  contour.
- **Shape knob (0–100)** — per-wave morph: sine = wavefold amount, triangle/saw
  = exponential bend, square = pulse width 50→5%, perlin = detuned octave
  shimmer, randomWalk = step size, smoothRandom = slew. Drift moves it ±30.
- knob.js gained a `tip` option: a persistent tooltip suffix (caveat text) that
  survives repaints.
- Guide updated: Tempo caveat, Gate mode, Rotate, Wave (perlin), Shape entries.

**Test tools now on the phone (outside the repo):** `fm1batch` (one-USB-session
scripted ops: read/write/param/sweep/clock/sleep — the ONLY reliable way to
drive the FM-1: repeated termux-usb claim/release cycles make the device deaf
until replug), `fm1param`, `fm1clock`, `fm1-tempo-test.py` (syx patcher with
correct checksum at 175 / F7 at 176), `fm1-tempo-battery.sh`.

**Still open:** the audible F8 follow test (unit Timing→Sync=On, app streams
clock) — gset proves nothing, needs ears on the device.
